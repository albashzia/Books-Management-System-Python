# Books-Management-System-Python
A simple console-based Books Management System written in Python.  
This project is intended for learning purposes and demonstrates basic data handling, user interaction, and list management in Python.

## Features

- Add books with title, author, and genre
- Search books by genre (case-insensitive)
- Remove books using a keyword from the title
- Menu-driven console interface

## How It Works

The system stores:
- Book titles
- Authors
- Genres

These are maintained using parallel lists, ensuring that each book’s information remains synchronized across lists.

The user interacts with the system through a numbered menu, selecting actions such as adding, searching, or removing books.
